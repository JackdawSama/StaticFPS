# PRJCT VJRA V0.01
 
## Overview

PRJCT VJRA tries to explore the intersection of traversal and combat using its novel weapon system. The game encourages the player to actively think about movement and how the player moves to take decisions while in combat.

## Controls
* WASD to move around.
* Mouse to look.
* L.Shift to dash.
* L.Mouse Button to fire.

## Known Issues

* Dashing as a movement isn't responsive but Weapon System is responsive so ammo add is registered.
* Holding down fire continuously empties ammo without pausing between every shell.
* L.Shift spamming allows for single dash movement-wise but multiple Kinetic Shells are added to the player magazine.
